<h1> Protocols </h1>
	<h2>Plasmid isolation by alkaline lysis </h2>
		<p> This protocol tells you how to isolate plasmids from a liquid cell culture using alkaline lysis. </p>
		<br>		
		<br>
			<b>Materials</b>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Ice box with ice</li>
					<li>Solution 1: Tris-HCl, EDTA, RNase (4&degC for RNase stability)</li>
					<li>Solution 2: NaOH, SDS (Room temperature)</li>
					<li>Solution 3: KOAc (4&degC)</li>
					<li>Isopropanol or 100% ethanol (-20&degC) </li>
					<li>Bacterial cultures of choice</li>
				</ul>
			
			<b>Protocol</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Transfer 1.5 mL of cell culture to an Eppendorf tube.</li>
					<li>Centrifuge 2 minutes at 13,400 rpm and pour off the supernatant.</li>
					<li>Add 200 &micro;L of solution 1 to the pellet. Vortex/resuspend the pellet thoroughly.</li>
					<li>Add 400 &micro;L of solution 2 and mix <u>carefully </u>by inverting.</li>
					<li>Add 300 &micro;L of ice cold solution 3 and mix by shaking. Put the mixture on ice for 5 minutes.</li>
					<li>Centrifuge 5 minutes at 13,400 rpm.</li>
					<li>Transfer the <u>SUPERNATANT </u>(!) to a new eppendorf tube - do not throw it away!</li>
					<li>Add 600 &micro;L of ice cold isopropanol or 100% ethanol and put the mixture on ice for 5 minutes.</li>
					<li>Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 13,400 rpm.</li>
					<li>Pipette the supernatant off and place the eppendorf tubes with open lids in a rack to dry the pellet. If dry, the pellet should be resuspended in, for example, 50 &micro;l demiwater.</li>
				</ul>
				
	<h2>Transformation </h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		
			<b>Materials</b>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Table centrifuge </li>
					<li>Plates (with antibiotics if needed)</li>
					<li>Competent cells</li>
					<li>Ice</li>
					<li>Waterbath (42&degC)</li>
					<li>SOC/LB medium (SOC preffered)</li>
				</ul>
			
			<b>Protocol</b>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Put competent cells from -80&degC on ice. Leave on ice for 30 minutes.</li>
					<li>Add all of your ligation mix (or x amount of whatever mix you want to transform)to the cells. Keep cells as much on ice as possible, flick the cells after adding mix to ensure homologous distribution. Leave 30 minutes on ice.</li>
					<li>Heat shock the cells. Do this 30-90 seconds (30 seconds is fine) at 42&degC. Important is to ensure the cells experience actual 42&degC, use a waterbath for this and swirl the tubes in the water during heat shock.</li>
					<li>Put 2 minutes on ice.</li>
					<li>Add 950 &micro;l SOC medium and grow at 37&degC and 250rpm for 45-60 minutes. Note: we use big shaker on 150 rpm for this, no shaking heat block available. Note: you can also use LB instead of SOC (SOC is preffered).</li>
					<li>Plate 2 plates, 1 with 50 &microl culture and 1 with the rest of your culture ~1ml. Make sure you have the appropriate antibiotics in your plates. To plate 1ml of culture I spin down the cells (after plating all 50 &micro;l plates) in table centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 2 minutes. Decant the supernatant (not everything!) to leave around 50-100 &micro;l of LB/SOC, resuspend and plate.</li>
					<li>Put in stove 37&degC for O/N
				</ul>

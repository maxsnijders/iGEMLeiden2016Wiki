			<b>Procedure </b>: <br>
			<u>Cell measurement protocol</u>
				<ul>
					<li>Transformed E. coli DH5alpha with the plasmids: - Positive control - Negative control - Device 1: J23101+I13504 - Device 2: J23106+I13504 - Device 3: J23117+I13504</li>
					<li>No plasmids were present in the tubes we obtained for the interlab study. </li>
					<li>Therefore 10microliter of milliQ was added to the tubes. </li>
					<li>Mixed with vortex and spinned down.</li>
					<li>50microliters competent cells (red spot) + 10 microliters of the milliQ with plasmids was added. </li>
					<li>30 minutes incubation on ice. </li>
					<li>Heatshock 42 &degC 30 sec 1mL LB was added</li> 
					<li>Shaking at 37 &degC 1 hour 100 microliter and 500 microliter on plates</li>
				</ul>

			<u>Cell measurement protocol</u>
		No colonies were visible. We will perform this again when we have good plasmids.

		<u>2.Protocol FITC fluorescence standard curve </u>
				<ul>
					<li>Spinned down FITC stock tube </li>
					<li>Added 1mL 1xPBS to this FITC tube</li> 
					<li>Incubated 42degrees for 4 hours </li>
					<li>Made a dilution series starting with 200 microliters FITC 5x stock (2.5microM) constantly diluting it twice in 1xPBS and ending with 100 microliters 1xPBS. </li>
					<li>This was performed 4 times </li>
					<li>The fluorescence of GFP was measured with a plate reader.</li>
				</ul>

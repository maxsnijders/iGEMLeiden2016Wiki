	<h1> DNA assembly Labjournal </h1>
		<h2>Experimental setup </h2>
			<p> In this track, the DNA received from IDT was assembled in pBluescript plasmids using Gibson Assemblies. Inserts were checked using colony-PCR on white colonies, after which frozen plasmid stocks were made and the constructs were checked in detail using sequencing.
				After this, the four BioBricks were placed in the right order using two subsequent rounds of 3A Assembly. </p>

		<h2>IDTDNA solution, grow pBluescript E. coli</h2> 
			<p><i>Day1: 2016/07/04 </i> <br>
				<b> Investigator(s): Sjoerd Seekles, Lisanne van Oosterhoud, Charlotte van de Velde </b> <br>
				<b>Procedure</b>:<br>
				First labwork started. IDTDNA was delivered as powder. On the information sheet they recommend to disolve their DNA in 100ul water. Which will result in a concentration of 10 ng/&micro;l (1000ng total in the tube).
				<br>
				For this we spin down the tubes. Add (warmed up 60&degC) MQ water (fresh water, fresh pipet tips). Short vortexing (set the vortex at 1 pm). The DNA was put in 60&degC stove for 30 minutes. Then again spin down plus vortex. Put in the -20&degC.
				<br>
				Took from -80&degC stock of Dennis some pBluescript to grow on LB+Xgal+IPTG+AMP. (20&micro;l per plate, stock 0.1M IPTG, 40 mg/ml Xgal and 100 mg/ml Amp). Also grow pBluescript in liquid (add Amp 1:1000).

	<h2> Plasmid isolation from strains with moaA or cld</h2>
		<p><i>Day4: 2016/07/13 </i> <br>
				<b>Investigator(s): Valentijn Broeken, Wouter Liefting, Lisanne Oosterhoud, Lizah van der Aart  </b> <br>
				<b>Procedure </b>: 
				The Plasmid isolation by Alkaline lysis protocol was used to isolate the plasmids from the white colonies grown in liquid LB medium. For 14 cultures, the anticipated insert was cld, and for 14 other cultures this was moaA. No chloroform/phenol extraction was performed.
				<br>
				The isolated plasmids were then dissolved in 50 &micro;l of demi water and the nucleic acid concentration was measured using a Nanodrop, together with the 260/280 ratio (protein contamination) and 260/230 ratio (contamination by salts and solvents).
				<br>
				<b> Results:</b> The Nanodrop values were extremely high. In the follow-up experiment (putting the samples on gel), it turned out that most of it was RNA.

	<h2> Gel electrophoresis of the isolated moaA or cld plasmids</h2>
		<p><i>Day5: 2016/07/14 </i> <br>
				<b>Investigator(s): Valentijn Broeken  </b> <br>
				<b>Procedure </b>: 
				To roughly check whether the anticipated inserts were present in the isolated plasmids, samples were digested with two restriction enzymes flanking the inserts (PstI and EcoRI) and subsequently put on a gel.
				<br>
				For each insert, five samples with high 260/280 and 260/230 ratios (both >1.9) and high nucleic acid concentrations (>2500 ng/&micro;l) were selected.
				<br>
				The digestion was performed in a volume of 20 &micro;l:
	<ul>
		<li> 11 &micro;l MilliQ</li>
		<li > 2 &micro;l Restriction buffer 2.1 (NEB)</li>
		<li > 5 &micro;l Isolated plasmid solution</li>
		<li > 1 &micro;l PstI</li>
		<li > 1 &micro;l EcoRI</li>
	</ul>	
		The mixture was put at 37Â°C for 1 hour.
		</p>
		<p>
				<br>
				A gel containing 1% agarose was made by Lisanne the day before. Of each digestion mixture, 5 &micro;l supplemented with 1 &micro;l purple loading dye (NEB) was put on the gel. The gel run for 55 minutes at 100V. As a ladder, 5 &micro;l of the Quick Load 2-log DNA ladder (NEB) was used.
				<br>	
				After running, the gel was stained 30 minutes in a 0.5 &micro;g/ml ethidiumbromide in 1x TAE solution, after which it was washed during 30 minutes in 1x TAE (not necessary).
				<br>
				Expectations After digestion with EcoRI and PstI, the following fragments are expected:
		</p>
	<ul>
		<li>cld-BioBrick: 888 basepairs </li>
		<li>moaA-BioBrick: 1011 basepairs </li>

	<p>
	<b>Conclusion </b>
	It is hard to draw conclusions from this gel, since RNA makes up most of the nucleic acid in the samples and no control pBluescript plasmid was added. The bands around 2-3kb could be pBluescript, but it is under debate why it would appear at two different heights then. There are really weak bands visible around 4kb, which could be the uncut plasmid containing the insert, but no fragments around 1 kb could be discovered - being the expected height for the digested inserts of moaA or cld.
	<br>
	To be able to draw firmer conclusions, a colony PCR was performed.

		<p><i>Day5: 2016/07/14 </i> <br>
				<b>Investigator(s): Valentijn Broeken, Lizah van der Aart  </b> <br>
				<b>Procedure </b>: 
				Since the digestion check wasn't successful in verifying whether inserts of the correct length were present in the pBluescript plasmids, a colony PCR was performed (see Q5 Colony PCR protocol with a 72&degC step of 45 sec). For each fragment, 1 blue and 7 white colonies were selected from the X-gal plates of the Gibson Assembly. Besides, an intact pBluescript was used as a control. 13M forward and reverse primers were used to amplify the insert in pBluescript. The PCR products were put on a gel to determine their length.

		The same PCR programme as at 2016/07/14 was used. This meant that the 72&degC step turned out to be too short (only 45 sec) for the 5.6kb fragment to be amplified (which would require 168 sec), resulting in incomplete bands on the gel. Therefore, the strains showing bands were once again used for a colony PCR with these longer 72&degC steps of 2min48. The bacteria used for the second PCR were transferred from the streaks made this morning during the first colony PCR.
		<br>
		These amplified samples were stored at 4&degC to put on a gel later.
